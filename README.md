# What is Word Counter for

Word Counter is made for counting the number of words in a string.
It can be used in any python code that needs to check how many words
are in a string and print the number of words in the string if
desired.

## Counter.py

Counter.py has two functions that take and return the number of words in a string.

### Count words function

The function `count_words()` takes a string and returns the number
of words in the string. To call the function, type the following:

```
count_words(wordString)
```

Where `wordString` is the string.

### Get Input function

The function `get_input()` takes an input from the terminal,
stringifies it, and returns the number of words in the string. To
call the function, type the following:

```
get_input(priint)
```

Where priint needs to be a boolean. If priint equals `True` then
the function prints the number of words in the string.

## input_counter.py
Input_counter.py basicly runs the `get_input()` function.
